  <ul style={{color: 'white'}}>
    <li>Nori Seaweed: Nori sheets are essential for rolling sushi. They add a subtle ocean flavor and help bind everything together.</li>
    <li>Sushi Rice: Sushi rice is the sticky rice used in traditional sushi. It's seasoned with rice vinegar, sugar, and salt for a tangy, slightly sweet taste.</li>
    <li>Fresh Vegetables: Use a variety of fresh and crisp vegetables like cucumber, avocado, bell peppers, carrots, and scallions to provide texture and flavor.</li>
    <li>Vegan Protein: Tofu, tempeh, and marinated mushrooms are excellent protein choices for vegan sushi.</li>

            <strong>Vegan Italian Recipe: Eggplant Parmesan</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Eggplant Parmesan, or "Melanzane alla Parmigiana," is a classic Italian dish that's both comforting and flavorful. This vegan version replaces traditional mozzarella and Parmesan cheese with dairy-free alternatives while retaining the mouthwatering essence of the original.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>2 large eggplants, sliced into 1/2-inch rounds</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour (or gluten-free flour)</li>
            <li>1 cup plant-based milk (almond, soy, oat, etc.)</li>
            <li>2 cups bread crumbs (use gluten-free if needed)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>Olive oil for frying</li>
            <li>2 cups marinara sauce (store-bought or homemade)</li>
            <li>1 cup vegan mozzarella cheese (shredded)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup vegan parmesan cheese (grated)</li>
            <li>Fresh basil leaves for garnish</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 375Â°F (190Â°C).</li>
            <li>Start by setting up a breading station. In one bowl, place the flour. In another bowl, whisk together the plant-based milk, oregano, basil, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. In a third bowl, combine the bread crumbs with a pinch of salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Dredge each eggplant slice in the flour, then dip it into the milk mixture, and finally coat it with the bread crumbs. Ensure each slice is well-coated and place them on a baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Heat some olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add the breaded eggplant slices and cook until they are golden brown on both sides. You may need to do this in batches.</li>
            <li>In a separate ovenproof dish, spread a thin layer of marinara sauce. Place the cooked eggplant slices on top of the sauce, then add a layer of vegan mozzarella and vegan parmesan. Repeat this layering process until all the ingredients are used.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes or until the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.</li>
            <li>Garnish with fresh basil leaves before serving.</li>

    <p><strong>Vegan Sushi Recipe: Avocado and Mango Sushi Rolls</strong></p>
  <p>Let's get started with a delicious vegan sushi recipe that combines the creaminess of avocado with the sweetness of mango for a refreshing and satisfying roll.</p>
  <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>For the Sushi Rice:
      <ul>
        <li>1 cup sushi rice</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>For the Avocado and Mango Filling:
      <ul>
        <li>1 ripe avocado, sliced</li>
        <li>1 ripe mango, sliced</li>
        <li>1 cucumber, julienned</li>
        <li>4 nori sheets</li>
        <li>Soy sauce, tamari, or coconut aminos for dipping</li>
        <li>Pickled ginger and wasabi (optional, for serving)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>Rinse the sushi rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Cook the rice according to the package instructions. Once cooked, transfer the rice to a large bowl and let it cool slightly.</li>
    <li>In a small saucepan, combine the rice vinegar, sugar, and salt. Heat over low heat until the sugar and salt dissolve. Pour the vinegar mixture over the cooked rice and gently fold it in with a wooden spatula to evenly coat the rice. Let the rice cool to room temperature.</li>
    <li>Lay a bamboo sushi rolling mat on a clean, flat surface. Place a sheet of plastic wrap on top of the mat.</li>
    <li>Lay one nori sheet, shiny side down, on the plastic wrap. Wet your fingers and take a handful of sushi rice, spreading it evenly over the nori sheet, leaving about 1 inch at the top without rice.</li>
    <li>Arrange the avocado, mango, and cucumber strips in the center of the rice.</li>
    <li>Gently lift the edge of the bamboo mat closest to you and start rolling the sushi away from you, tucking in the filling as you go. Use a little water on the nori to seal the roll.</li>
    <li>Once you've rolled it completely, use a sharp, wet knife to slice the sushi roll into bite-sized pieces.</li>
    <li>Serve your avocado and mango sushi rolls with soy sauce, pickled ginger, and wasabi.</li>
